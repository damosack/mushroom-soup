    It's difficult to objectively identify anything which might have been defining (or even unique) about my K-12 education, relative to what other people might have experienced in other places, or at other times, since the one I now have is the only one I have ever really known. I do, however, distinctly recall the frequent laments of my teachers, bemoaning standardized testing and "no child left behind" as the misguided and poisonous principles of a new, unimaginative pedagogy. In discussions thereof, it was clear to me that I should recognize myself as the unfortunate victim of unfortunate, political developments. 
    
    In secret reality, I hardly ever knew what to make of this sentiment, though I made myself agreeable to it often. I did well in school, and received good grades, so if there was a problem for some, I was confident it didn't concern me (likely true now that I think about it, but at the time systemic racism wasn't on my mind). Usually I did my best to finish homework during class, and when I had no homework to do, I did my best to find something interesting to waste my attention on, something which almost certainly had nothing to do with the lesson at hand. As a brief aside, if this comes off as boastful, it seems now like an opportune moment to point out that being "too smart for school" is, as a matter of course, not really that impressive to anyone, at any time, but especially when the school is elementary and the person is at least a somewhat grown adult. In any event, I generally considered school an awful bore, though it had a few redeeming qualities. For one, it gave me an excuse to leave the house, and moreover they sometimes even let me do a bit of reading here and there, which was always nice. 
    
    My favorite thing about it though, and I suspect most people wouldn't agree here, was the tests. Oh boy did I love taking tests. Not for any good reason, as if I valued the opportunity to discover the limits of my knowledge, or something so self-disciplined as that: I just loved the dopamine hit I got when the score came back, and I knew what it was going to say. When it was an A, I was intoxicated by the reassurance that I really was smarter, and therefore better, than everyone else; when it was not, I was resentful of "unfair questions" or "bad teaching," or whatever excuse laid most readily at hand. 
    
    Eventually the obvious became evident even to me, despite the valiance of my narcissistic density. I wasn't smarter, and I certainly wasn't better than anybody else, I was just a good test taker. That I managed to maintain a reasonably decent GPA for so long while going through the motions of an education is surely an indictment of both my juvenile egocentrism and the flaccid standards of Egelston township's public schools, but eventually my intellectual stagnation did catch up with me.
    
    In my second year of high school I was taking an AP art history course, which turned out in retrospect to be by far the most challenging class I would take in high school, to my great surprise and eventual enrichment. It was a class replete with route memorization of obscure historical details, innumerable apparently important dates, and, well - lets just say it was very hard. The first few quizes and exams came back at once, and the instructor pulled me aside to let me know I was failing the course. I don't remember my response, just what he asked me in reply, which was "when was the last time you actually tried to do your best on something?" Not just to pass, or to get by, he elaborated, but for the thing in itself? His disappointment (and my literal failure) made me reflective. What was the point of school? Education, of course - and yet I felt like I wasn't really growing from year to year. It was always learn, test, and forget. 
    
    All this to say that when I read Kohn's piece, it's hard to find anything to disagree with. I know first hand that grading is corrosive to any earnest motivation to acquire knowledge. It is often bizarre how students (including myself) and instructors are willing to work together to ignore this basic fact in their united, petty pursuit of higher evaluations. For instance, I have been supplied on more than one occasion with a practice exam which is completely identical to the actual midterm or final for which it was intended to serve as study guide. Surely once instructors are resorting to providing the actual exam as study material there can be no more intellectual justification for that study than for a word search in the sunday newspaper, and yet this is the lemming insanity normalized in traditional education, which even I sometimes find myself mindlessly afraid to abandon.
